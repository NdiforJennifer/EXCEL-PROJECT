# VISUALIZATION IN EXCEL-PROJECT

This project focuses on creating dashboards in Excel using grocery data from Blinkit. The dataset contains 8,424 entries and includes various fields: Item Fat Content, Item Identifier, Item Type, Outlet, Establishment Year, Outlet Identifier, Outlet Location Type, Outlet Size, Outlet Type, Item Visibility, Item, Weight, Sales, and Rating.
First, I cleaned the data by using the find and replace feature and checked for duplicates. I then developed dashboards to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) for improved analysis.
I created several pivot tables and generated charts from these pivot tables, which I then copied and pasted onto my dashboard for editing. Additionally, I created slicers for Outlet Size, Item Type, and Outlet Location.

BUSINESS REQUIREMENT KPI’s 

Total Sales; The overall revenue generated from all items sold

Average Sales; The average revenue per sales

Number of Items; The total Count of Different items sold

Average Rating; The average Customer rating for items sold

CHART REQUIREMENTS

Total Sales by Fat Content

Chart Type: Donut Chart

Total Sales by Item Type:

Objective: Identify the performance of different item types in terms of total sales Additional KPI Metrics: Assess how other KPI’s (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content Chart Type: Bar Chart

Fat content by outlet for total sales

Objective; Compare total sales across different outlets segmented by fat content Additional KPI Metrics: Assess how other KPI’s (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat contentChart Type: Stacked column Chart

Total Sales by outlet Establishment

Objectives: Evaluate how the age or type of outlet establishment influences total sales Chart Type: Line Chart

Sales by Outlet Size 

Objectives: Analyze the correlation between outlet size and total salesChart Type: Donut/ Pie Chart

Sales by outlet Location

Objective: Assess the geographic distribution of sales across different locations Chart Type: Water Fall, I wanted to use the Funnel chart but this chart is available only under Office 365 subscription and not in Excel 2016 which is what I currently have


All metrics by Outlet Type

Objectives; Provide a comprehensive view of all key metrics (Total sales, Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) Broken down by different outlet types Chart Type: Matrix Card

Please feel free to critique my work; doing so will help me get better at future visualization projects.
